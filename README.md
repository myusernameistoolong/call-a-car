# 🚗 Call-a-Car – Afstuderen Light Project
Call-a-Car is a hypothetical project created as part of the Afstuderen Light course. It was not meant to be fully developed but served as an exercise to carefully think through and design an application within a given virtual context. The project focuses on a futuristic car-sharing service using self-driving vehicles to replace car ownership. The concept includes a customer-facing app, an admin system with user roles, and integration with a third-party parking API. Throughout the process, research was conducted using interviews, documentation, and stakeholder requirements, with strong attention to privacy, accessibility, and sustainability and integration with a third-party API('s). Time constraints were a conscious obstacle in the project to test prioritization and decision-making throughout development.

This application is built using:

- Web technologies
- Laravel (PHP) for both backend and frontend (Blade templating) 
- MongoDB with Mongoose (NoSQL) for flexible data handling 
- MVC architecture 
- RESTful API Some features like fingerprint-based payments were scoped out due to time constraints but planned for future integration.

## 🎯 Goal
“Develop a platform to replace car ownership with a pay-per-use self-driving car service.”

## 🧩 Key Features
Web-based application with a focus on mobile usability.

User roles and permissions, including regular users and admins.

Trip booking system with a discount model for loyal customers.

Integration with third-party API for parking availability.

Offline fallback through downloadable PDF with booking info.

Future-proof design prepared for integration with biometric payments and native mobile apps.

Privacy-focused, respecting user rights in collaboration with Bits of Freedom.

## 📌 Project Context
The application was developed in response to a fictional startup initiative, supported by several stakeholders including:

Bits of Freedom – for privacy advocacy

Ministry of Infrastructure – promoting future mobility

Startup founder: Alex Aanvoerder

Due to time constraints, some features (like fingerprint-based payments) were documented but not yet implemented.

## 🌱 Sustainability Impact
Call-a-Car contributes to three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aiming to reduce the environmental impact of private car ownership by promoting shared autonomous transport.
